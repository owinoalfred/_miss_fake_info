Workflow
The Document Summarizer and Misinformation Detector application is designed to help users quickly summarize long documents and verify the accuracy of summarized text against misinformation. Below is the detailed workflow of how the application functions:

User Input:

The user is presented with a text area to input the document they want to summarize. This document can be any text content, such as an article, report, or essay.
Summarization Process:

Upon clicking the "Summarize" button, the application processes the input document using the Document Summarizer component. This component employs natural language processing techniques to generate a concise summary of the provided text.
Display Summary:

After processing, the summarized text is displayed to the user under the "Summary" section. This provides the user with a quick overview of the main points from the original document.
Misinformation Detection:

The application then automatically checks the summarized text for misinformation using the Misinformation Detector component. This component analyzes the summary to identify any potentially misleading or false information.
Display Misinformation Check Result:

The result of the misinformation check is displayed in a separate section labeled "Misinformation Check Result". This informs the user whether the summary contains any identified misinformation.
Optional Misinformation Claim Check:

Additionally, users can input specific claims they want to verify against misinformation. They can enter a claim in another text area and click the "Check Misinformation" button.
The application processes this claim using the same misinformation detection logic and displays the results for the user.
User Feedback:

Users can provide feedback or enter new documents or claims for further summarization and misinformation checks.
Additional Notes

Integration of AI Components: Both the summarization and misinformation detection processes leverage advanced AI techniques, ensuring accurate and reliable results.
Educational Use: The application is intended for educational and informational purposes, helping users discern the accuracy of information in their documents.
